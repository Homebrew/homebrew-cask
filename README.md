# Homebrew Cask

_‚ÄúTo install, drag this icon‚Ä¶‚Äù no more!_

Homebrew Cask extends [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) and brings its elegance, simplicity, and speed to the installation and management of GUI macOS applications such as Atom and Google Chrome.

We do this by providing a friendly CLI workflow for the administration of macOS applications distributed as binaries.

## Let‚Äôs try it!

To start using Homebrew Cask, you just need [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed.

Slower, now:

```
$ brew cask install atom
==> Satisfying dependencies
complete
==> Downloading https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/download/v1.8.0/atom-mac.zip
######################################################################## 100.0%
==> Verifying checksum for Cask atom
==> Moving App 'Atom.app' to '/Applications/Atom.app'
==> Symlinking Binary 'apm' to '/usr/local/bin/apm'
==> Symlinking Binary 'atom.sh' to '/usr/local/bin/atom'
üç∫  atom was successfully installed!
```

And there we have it. Atom installed with one quick command: no clicking, no dragging, no dropping.
