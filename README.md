# Homebrew-Cask

_‚ÄúTo install, drag this icon‚Ä¶‚Äù no more!_

Homebrew-Cask extends [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) and brings its elegance, simplicity, and speed to the installation and management of GUI macOS applications such as Google Chrome and Adium.

We do this by providing a friendly Homebrew-style CLI workflow for the administration of macOS applications distributed as binaries.

It‚Äôs implemented as a `homebrew` [external command](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/External-Commands.md) called `cask`.
