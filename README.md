# Homebrew-Cask

### Important 12/Aug/2015 update: Homebrew-cask will change its behaviour from linking apps to moving them. See [issue #13201](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/issues/13201) for details.

_“To install, drag this icon…” no more!_

Let’s see if we can get the elegance, simplicity, and speed of Homebrew for the installation and management of GUI Mac applications such as Google Chrome and Adium.

Homebrew-cask provides a friendly homebrew-style CLI workflow for the administration of Mac applications distributed as binaries.

It’s implemented as a `homebrew` [external command](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/External-Commands.md) called `cask`.

## Let’s try it!

```bash
$ brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask
$ brew cask install google-chrome
=> Downloading https://dl.google.com/chrome/mac/stable/GGRO/googlechrome.dmg
=> Success! google-chrome installed to /opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom/google-chrome/stable-channel
=> Linking Google Chrome.app to /Users/phinze/Applications/Google Chrome.app
```

And there we have it. Google Chrome installed with a few quick commands: no clicking, no dragging, no dropping.

```bash
$ open ~/Applications/"Google Chrome.app"
```

## Reporting Bugs

We still have bugs — and we are busy fixing them!  If you have a problem, don’t be shy about reporting it on our [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/issues?state=open). Always search for your issue before posting a new one.

When reporting bugs, remember that homebrew-cask is an independent project from Homebrew. Do your best to direct bug reports to the appropriate project. If your command-line started with `brew cask`, bring the bug to us first!

Before reporting a bug, make sure you have the latest versions of homebrew, homebrew-cask, and all Taps by running the following command:

```bash
$ brew update && brew upgrade brew-cask && brew cleanup && brew cask cleanup
```

If the issue persists, please run the problematic command with the `--verbose` flag and post its and `brew cask doctor`’s outputs in distinct [fenced code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/#fenced-code-blocks).
