# Homebrew-Cask

_‚ÄúTo install, drag this icon‚Ä¶‚Äù no more!_

Homebrew-Cask extends [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) and brings its elegance, simplicity, and speed to the installation and management of GUI macOS applications such as Google Chrome and Adium.

We do this by providing a friendly Homebrew-style CLI workflow for the administration of macOS applications distributed as binaries.

It‚Äôs implemented as a `homebrew` [external command](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/External-Commands.md) called `cask`.

## Let‚Äôs try it!

To start using Homebrew-Cask, you just need [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) installed.

```bash
$ brew cask install google-chrome
==> Downloading https://dl.google.com/chrome/mac/stable/GGRO/googlechrome.dmg
==> Moving App 'Google Chrome.app' to '/Applications/Google Chrome.app'
üç∫  google-chrome staged at '/usr/local/Caskroom/google-chrome/latest' (3 files, 288K)
```

And there we have it. Google Chrome installed with a few quick commands: no clicking, no dragging, no dropping.

```bash
$ open /Applications/"Google Chrome.app"
```
