Let's see if we can get the elegance, simplicity, and speed of Homebrew for the
installation and management of GUI Mac applications such as Google Chrome and Adium.

`brew-cask` provides a friendly homebrew-style CLI workflow for the
administration of Mac applications distributed as binaries.

It's implemented as a `homebrew` "[external
command](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/External-Commands)" called
`cask`.

## Let's try it!
```sh
$ brew tap phinze/homebrew-cask
$ brew install brew-cask
$ brew cask install google-chrome
=> Downloading https://dl.google.com/chrome/mac/stable/GGRO/googlechrome.dmg
=> Success! google-chrome installed to /opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom/google-chrome/stable-channel
=> Linking Google Chrome.app to /Users/phinze/Applications/Google Chrome.app
```
And there we have it. Google Chrome installed with a few quick commands: no clicking, no dragging, no dropping.
```sh
open ~/Applications/"Google Chrome.app"
```
