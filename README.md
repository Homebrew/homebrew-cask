# Homebrew Cask

_‚ÄúTo install, drag this icon‚Ä¶‚Äù no more!_

Homebrew Cask extends [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) and brings its elegance, simplicity, and speed to the installation and management of GUI macOS applications such as Atom and Google Chrome.

We do this by providing a friendly CLI workflow for the administration of macOS applications distributed as binaries.

## Let‚Äôs try it!

To start using Homebrew Cask, you just need [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed.

Slower, now:

```
$ brew install alfred
==> Downloading https://cachefly.alfredapp.com/Alfred_4.2.1_1187.dmg
######################################################################## 100.0%
==> Verifying SHA-256 checksum for Cask 'alfred'.
==> Installing Cask alfred
==> Moving App 'Alfred 4.app' to '/Applications/Alfred 4.app'.
üç∫  alfred was successfully installed!
```

And there we have it. An application installed with one quick command: no clicking, no dragging, no dropping.
