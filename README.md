# Homebrew-Cask

_‚ÄúTo install, drag this icon‚Ä¶‚Äù no more!_

Homebrew-Cask extends [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) and brings its elegance, simplicity, and speed to the installation and management of GUI macOS applications such as Google Chrome and Adium.

We do this by providing a friendly Homebrew-style CLI workflow for the administration of macOS applications distributed as binaries.

It‚Äôs implemented as a `homebrew` [external command](http://docs.brew.sh/External-Commands.html) called `cask`.

Slower, now:

```
$ brew cask install atom

==> Verifying checksum for Cask atom
==> Moving App 'Atom.app' to '/Applications/Atom.app'
==> Symlinking Binary 'apm' to '/usr/local/bin/apm'
==> Symlinking Binary 'atom.sh' to '/usr/local/bin/atom'
üç∫  atom was successfully installed!

And there we have it. Atom installed with one quick command: no clicking, no dragging, no dropping.

## Reporting bugs

[**If you ignore this guide, your issue may be closed without review**](doc/faq/closing_issues_without_review.md).

Before reporting a bug, run `brew update-reset && brew update` and try your command again. This will ensure the problem isn‚Äôt an outdated setup on your side. Note this command is a fix-all that will reset the state of all your taps, so if you have changes on those that you want to keep, deal with them first.

If your issue persists, search for it before opening a new one. If you find an open issue and have any new information not reported in the original, please add your insights. If you find a closed issue, try the solutions there.
