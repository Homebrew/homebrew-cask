# Homebrew-Cask

#### Important December 2015 update: Homebrew-Cask will now be kept up to date together with Homebrew (see [#15381](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/pull/15381) for details). If you haven’t yet, run `brew uninstall --force brew-cask; brew update` to switch to the new system.

#### Important: At some point in the future Homebrew-Cask will change its behaviour from linking apps to moving them. See [issue #13201](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/issues/13201) for details.

_“To install, drag this icon…” no more!_

Homebrew-Cask extends [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) and brings its elegance, simplicity, and speed to the installation and management of GUI Mac applications such as Google Chrome and Adium.

We do this by providing a friendly Homebrew-style CLI workflow for the administration of Mac applications distributed as binaries.

It’s implemented as a `homebrew` [external command](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/External-Commands.md) called `cask`.

## Let’s try it!

To start using Homebrew-Cask, you just need [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) installed.

```bash
$ brew cask install google-chrome
==> Downloading https://dl.google.com/chrome/mac/stable/GGRO/googlechrome.dmg
==> Symlinking App 'Google Chrome.app' to '/Users/Your_Account_Name/Applications/Google Chrome.app'
🍺  google-chrome staged at '/opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom/google-chrome/latest' (208 files, 184M)
```

And there we have it. Google Chrome installed with a few quick commands: no clicking, no dragging, no dropping.

```bash
$ open ~/Applications/"Google Chrome.app"
```

## Reporting Bugs

We still have bugs — and we are busy fixing them!  If you have a problem, don’t be shy about [reporting it][bug_report_template] on our [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/issues?state=open). Always search for your issue before posting a new one.

When reporting bugs, remember that Homebrew-Cask is an independent project from Homebrew. Do your best to direct bug reports to the appropriate project. If your command-line started with `brew cask`, bring the bug to us first!

Before reporting a bug, make sure you have the latest versions of Homebrew, Homebrew-Cask, and all Taps by running the following command:

```bash
$ brew update; brew cleanup; brew cask cleanup
```

In addition, if you haven’t yet, run the following once to [switch to the new system](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask#important-december-update-homebrew-cask-will-now-be-kept-up-to-date-together-with-homebrew-see-15381-for-details-if-you-havent-yet-run-brew-uninstall---force-brew-cask-brew-update-to-switch-to-the-new-system):

```bash
$ brew uninstall --force brew-cask; brew update
```

If it's been a while since you last updated Homebrew-Cask, you may still have the old `phinze/cask` tap installed. Run the following to clean up, then try your command again:

```bash
$ brew untap phinze/cask; brew untap caskroom/cask; brew update
```

If the issue persists, please use our [bug report template][bug_report_template] to report the output of running the problematic command with the `--verbose` flag, along with the output of `brew cask doctor`.
