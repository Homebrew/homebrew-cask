.TH "BREW\-CASK" "1" "August 2016" "Homebrew-Cask" "brew-cask"
.
.SH "NAME"
\fBbrew\-cask\fR \- a friendly binary installer for macOS
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBbrew cask\fR command [options] [ \fItoken\fR \.\.\. ]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Homebrew\-Cask is a tool for installing precompiled macOS binaries (such as Applications) from the command line\. The user is never required to use the graphical user interface\.
.
.SH "ALPHA\-QUALITY SOFTWARE"
Homebrew\-Cask works robustly enough that we welcome new users, but the project is still in early development\. That means command names, option names, and other aspects of this manual are still subject to change\.
.
.SH "FREQUENTLY USED COMMANDS"
.
.TP
\fBinstall [\-\-force] [\-\-skip\-cask\-deps] [\-\-require\-sha]\fR \fItoken\fR [ \fItoken\fR \.\.\. ]
Install Cask identified by \fItoken\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBuninstall [\-\-force]\fR \fItoken\fR [ \fItoken\fR \.\.\. ]
Uninstall Cask identified by \fItoken\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBsearch\fR \fItext\fR | /\fIregexp\fR/
Perform a substring search of known Cask tokens for \fItext\fR\. If the text is delimited by slashes, it is interpreted as a Ruby regular expression\.
.
.IP
The tokens returned by \fBsearch\fR are suitable as arguments for most other commands, such as \fBinstall\fR or \fBuninstall\fR\.
.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.
.TP
\fBaudit\fR [ \fItoken\fR \.\.\. ]

.
.TP
\fBcat\fR \fItoken\fR [ \fItoken\fR \.\.\. ]
Dump the given Cask definition file to the standard output\.
.
.TP
\fBcleanup\fR [\-\-outdated]
Clean up cached downloads and tracker symlinks\. With \fB\-\-outdated\fR, only clean up cached downloads older than 10 days old\.
.
.TP

Open the given Cask definition file for editing\.
.
.TP
\fBfetch\fR [\-\-force] \fItoken\fR [ \fItoken\fR \.\.\. ]

.
.TP
\fBhome\fR or \fBhomepage\fR [ \fItoken\fR \.\.\. ]
Display the homepage associated with a given Cask in a browser\.
.
.IP
With no arguments, display the project page \fIhttp://caskroom\.io\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBinfo\fR or \fBabv\fR \fItoken\fR [ \fItoken\fR \.\.\. ]
Display information about the given Cask\.
.
.TP
\fBinstall [\-\-force] [\-\-skip\-cask\-deps] [\-\-require\-sha]\fR \fItoken\fR [ \fItoken\fR \.\.\. ]
Install the given Cask\. With \fB\-\-force\fR, re\-install even if the Cask appears to be already present\. With \fB\-\-skip\-cask\-deps\fR, skip any Cask dependencies\. \fB\-\-require\-sha\fR will abort installation if the Cask does not have a checksum defined\.
.
.IP
\fItoken\fR is usually the ID of a Cask as returned by \fBbrew cask search\fR, but see \fIOTHER WAYS TO SPECIFY A CASK\fR for variations\.
.
.TP
\fBlist\fR or \fBls\fR [\-1 | \-l] [ \fItoken\fR \.\.\. ]
Without any arguments, list all installed Casks\. With \fB\-1\fR, always format the output in a single column\. With \fB\-l\fR, give a more detailed listing\.
.
.IP
If \fItoken\fR is given, summarize the staged files associated with the given Cask\.
.
.TP
\fBsearch\fR or \fB\-S\fR
Display all Casks available for install\.
.
.TP
\fBsearch\fR or \fB\-S\fR \fItext\fR | /\fIregexp\fR/
Perform a substring search of known Cask tokens for \fItext\fR\. If the text is delimited by slashes, it is interpreted as a Ruby regular expression\.
.
.TP
\fBstyle\fR [\-\-fix] [ \fItoken\fR \.\.\. ]
Check the given Casks for correct style using RuboCop Cask \fIhttps://github\.com/caskroom/rubocop\-cask\fR\. If no tokens are given on the command line, all Casks are checked\. With \fB\-\-fix\fR, auto\-correct any style errors if possible\.
.
.TP
\fBuninstall [\-\-force]\fR or \fBrm\fR or \fBremove\fR \fItoken\fR [ \fItoken\fR \.\.\. ]
Uninstall the given Cask\. With \fB\-\-force\fR, uninstall even if the Cask does not appear to be present\.
.
.IP
Note that \fBuninstall \-\-force\fR is currently imperfect\. It will follow the \fBuninstall\fR instructions from \fInewest\fR Cask definition, even if the given Cask has changed since you installed it\. The result is that \fBuninstall \-\-force\fR will always succeed in removing relevant files under \fB<Caskroom_path>\fR, but will sometimes fail to remove relevant installed files outside of it\. This issue is being addressed\.
.
.IP
\fBuninstall\fR without \fB\-\-force\fR is also imperfect\. It may be unable to perform an \fBuninstall\fR operation if the given Cask has changed since you installed it\. This issue is being addressed\.
.
.TP
\fBupdate\fR
For convenience\. \fBbrew cask update\fR is a synonym for \fBbrew update\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBzap\fR \fItoken\fR [ \fItoken\fR \.\.\. ]
Unconditionally remove \fIall\fR files associated with the given Cask\.
.
.IP
Implicitly performs all actions associated with \fBuninstall\fR, even if the Cask does not appear to be currently installed\.
.
.IP
Removes all staged versions of the Cask distribution found under \fB<Caskroom_path>/<token>\fR\.
.
.IP
If the Cask definition contains a \fBzap\fR stanza, performs additional \fBzap\fR actions as defined there, such as removing local preference files\. \fBzap\fR actions are variable, depending on the level of detail defined by the Cask author\.
.
.IP
\fB\fBzap\fR may remove files which are shared between applications\.\fR
.
.SH "OPTIONS"

.SH "INTERACTION WITH HOMEBREW"
Homebrew\-Cask is implemented as a external command for Homebrew\. That means this project is entirely built upon the Homebrew infrastructure\. For example, upgrades to the Homebrew\-Cask tool are received through Homebrew:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

brew update; brew cleanup; brew cask cleanup
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
And updates to individual Cask definitions are received whenever you issue the Homebrew command:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

brew update
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SH "OTHER WAYS TO SPECIFY A CASK"
Most Homebrew\-Cask commands can accept a Cask token as an argument\. As described above, the argument can take the form of:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A token as returned by \fBbrew cask search\fR, \fIeg\fR \fBgoogle\-chrome\fR
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Homebrew\-Cask also accepts three other forms in place of plain tokens:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A fully\-qualified token which includes the Tap name, \fIeg\fR \fBcaskroom/fonts/font\-symbola\fR
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A fully\-qualified pathname to a Cask file, \fIeg\fR \fB/usr/local/Library/Taps/caskroom/homebrew\-cask/Casks/google\-chrome\.rb\fR
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A \fBcurl\fR\-retrievable URI to a Cask file, \fIeg\fR \fBhttps://raw\.githubusercontent\.com/caskroom/homebrew\-cask/f25b6babcd398abf48e33af3d887b2d00de1d661/Casks/google\-chrome\.rb\fR
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
Homebrew\-Cask respects many of the environment variables used by the parent command \fBbrew\fR\. Please refer to the \fBbrew\fR(1) man page for more information\.
.
.P
Environment variables specific to Homebrew\-Cask:
.
.TP
HOMEBREW_CASK_OPTS
This variable may contain any arguments normally used as options on the command\-line\. This is particularly useful to make options persistent\. For example, you might add to your \.bash_profile or \.zshenv something like: \fBexport HOMEBREW_CASK_OPTS=\'\-\-appdir=/Applications \-\-caskroom=/etc/Caskroom\'\fR\.
.
.SH "SEE ALSO"

.SH "AUTHORS"

.P

.
.SH "BUGS"
We still have bugs — and we are busy fixing them! If you have a problem, don’t be shy about reporting it on our GitHub issues page \fIhttps://github\.com/caskroom/homebrew\-cask/issues?state=open\fR\.
.
.P
When reporting bugs, remember that Homebrew\-Cask is an independent project from Homebrew\. Do your best to direct bug reports to the appropriate project\. If your command\-line started with \fBbrew cask\fR, bring the bug to us first!
