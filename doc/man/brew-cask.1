.SH "INTERACTION WITH HOMEBREW"
Homebrew\-cask is implemented as a external command for Homebrew\. That means this project is entirely built upon the Homebrew infrastructure\. For example, upgrades to the Homebrew\-cask tool are received through Homebrew: brew update && brew upgrade brew\-cask
.
.P
And updates to individual Cask definitions are received whenever you issue the Homebrew command: brew update
.
.SH "OTHER WAYS TO SPECIFY A CASK"

.
.IP "\(bu" 4
A Cask name as returned by \fBbrew cask search\fR, \fIeg\fR \fBgoogle\-chrome\fR
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Homebrew\-cask also accepts three other forms for Cask names:
.

.
.IP "\(bu" 4
