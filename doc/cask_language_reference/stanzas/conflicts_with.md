# conflicts_with

`conflicts_with` is used to declare conflicts that keep a Cask from installing or working correctly.

Several keys are accepted by `conflicts_with`, but none of them are yet enforced by the backend implementation. It is fine to proactively add `conflicts_with` stanzas to Casks in anticipation of future backend support; they are currently just a type of structured comment.
