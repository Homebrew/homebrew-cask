# desc

`desc` accepts a single-line UTF-8 string (max. 80 characters) containing a short description of the software, and is used to help with searchability and disambiguation.

It should start with a capital letter, and avoid including the Cask [name](name.md). The full list of rules is described [here](https://github.com/homebrew/brew/blob/master/Library/Homebrew/rubocops/shared/desc_helper.rb).
