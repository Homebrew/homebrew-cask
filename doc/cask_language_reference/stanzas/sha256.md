# sha256

## Calculating the SHA256

The `sha256` value is usually calculated by the command:

```bash
$ shasum -a 256 <file>
```

## Special Value `:no_check`

The special value `sha256 :no_check` is used to turn off SHA checking whenever checksumming is impractical due to the upstream configuration.

`version :latest` requires `sha256 :no_check`, and this pairing is common. However, `sha256 :no_check` does not require `version :latest`.

We use a checksum whenever possible.

## Updating the SHA256

When updating the `sha256` stanza of an existing Cask, the `version` also has to have changed. Otherwise, the new checksum has to be confirmed by the developer.

The confirmation of the updated `sha256` should ideally be publicly available. Specifically:

 - If confirmed on Twitter, @mention [@homebrewcask](https://twitter.com/homebrewcask).
 - If confirmed on GitHub, @mention [one of the Homebrew-Cask maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/caskroom/people).
 - Otherwise, post a link to the developer's confirmation.
