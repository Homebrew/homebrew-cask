# sha256

## Calculating the SHA256

The `sha256` value is usually calculated by the command:

```bash
$ shasum -a 256 <file>
```

## Special Value `:no_check`

The special value `sha256 :no_check` is used to turn off SHA checking whenever checksumming is impractical due to the upstream configuration.

`version :latest` requires `sha256 :no_check`, and this pairing is common. However, `sha256 :no_check` does not require `version :latest`.

We use a checksum whenever possible.

## Updating the SHA256

When updating the `sha256` stanza of an existing Cask, the `version` also has to have changed. Otherwise, the new checksum has to be confirmed. This is necessary to help rule out malicious tampering.

The confirmation of the updated `sha256` should ideally be publicly available. Specifically:

- Post a link to the developer's confirmation.

- If the Cask is an `.app` that is [codesigned](https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/codesign.1.html) (in a `.dmg` or `.zip` container) it can be uploaded and verified using [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) by looking at the “Details” tab. 

   **If there is no *Signature Info* section, VirusTotal verification is not enough**.

   Maintainers will confirm the VirusTotal submission is legitimate by comparing its `sha256` with the one on the updated cask.
