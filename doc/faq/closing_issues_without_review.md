# If your issue was closed without review

Both the [reporting bugs section of the readme](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask#reporting-bugs) and [the bug report issue template you need to fill before opening an issue](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/blob/HEAD/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/01_bug_report.md) warn that if the instructions aren’t followed, your issue may be closed without review.

You might have been redirected to this document if it was apparent to a maintainer that was the case. We worked hard on those guides to keep things running smoothly, so we ask you go back and follow them. It is OK to open a new issue for that.

If the maintainer was wrong in closing your issue, please do reply stating why! Closing an issue does not mean the conversation is over. If the guides themselves were unclear, help us improve them! Open *first* an issue or pull request stating what you found confusing *and only then* your other issue.

We understand sometimes users are tired and don’t want to sift through a guide to make what they feel is a simple bug report. But when each user ignores the guides to save a few minutes, maintainers lose hours and get fatigued. Dealing with the same solved and documented problems leads to maintainer burnout and wasted hours. Those would be better spent improving Homebrew Cask itself and fixing real bugs. We ask you take that into consideration.

Thank you for understanding and taking the time to make a correct report. The whole team appreciates it.
