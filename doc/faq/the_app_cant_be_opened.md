# The app can’t be opened because it is from an unidentified developer

Chances are that certain apps will give you a popup message like this:

This is a [security feature from Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491). The single most important thing to know is that **you can allow individual apps to be exempt from that feature.** This allows the app to run while the rest of the system remains under protection.

**Always leave system-wide protection enabled,** and disable it only for specific apps as needed.

If you are sure you want to trust the app, you can disable protection for that app by right-clicking its icon and choosing `Open`:

Finally, click the `Open` button if you want macOS to permanently allow the app to run on this Mac. **Don’t do this unless you’re sure you trust the app.**
