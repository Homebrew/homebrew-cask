# Apps that bundle malware

Unfortunately, in the world of software there are bad actors that bundle malware with their apps. Even so, Homebrew Cask has long decided it will not be an active gatekeeper ([macOS already has one](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491)) and [users are expected to know about the software they are installing](not_a_discoverability_service.md). This means we will not always remove casks that link to these apps, in part because there is no clear line between useful app, potentially unwanted program, and the different shades of malware — what is useful to one user may be seen as malicious by another.

Within that context, we would still like for users to enjoy some kind of protection while minimising occurrences of legitimate developers being branded as malware carriers. To do so, we evaluate casks on a case-by-case basis, and any user is free to bring a potential malware case to our attention. It is, however, important to never forget the last line of defence is *always* the user.

If an app that bundles malware was not signed with an Apple Developer ID and you purposefully disabled or bypassed Gatekeeper, no action will be taken on our part. When you disable security features, you do so at your own risk. If, however, an app that bundles malware is signed, Apple can revoke its permissions and it will no longer run on the computers of users that keep security features on — we all benefit, Homebrew Cask users or not. To report a signed app that bundles malware, use [Apple’s Bug Reporter](https://bugreport.apple.com/)

We are also open to removing casks where we feel there is enough evidence that the app is malicious. To suggest a cask for removal, submit a Pull Request to delete it, together with your reasoning. Typically, this will mean presenting a [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com) scan of the app showing it is malicious, ideally with some other reporting indicating it’s not a false positive.

Likewise, software that provides both “clean” and malware-infested versions might be removed from the repo — even if we could have access to the *good* version — if its developers push for users to install the *bad* version. We do so because in these cases, there’s a higher than normal risk that both versions are (or will soon become) compromised in some manner.

If a cask you depend on was removed due to these rules, fear not. Removal of a cask from the official repositories means we won’t support it, but you can do so by hosting your own [tap](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/How-to-Create-and-Maintain-a-Tap.md).
