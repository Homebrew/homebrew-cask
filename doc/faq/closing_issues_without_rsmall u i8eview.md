+About access permissions on GitHubRuns-on:'Run'':
+To perform any actions on GitHub, such as creating a pull request in a repository or changing an organization's billing settings, a person must have sufficient access to the relevant account or resource. This access is controlled by permissions. A permission is the ability to perform a specific action. For example, the ability to delete an issue is a permission. A role is a set of permissions you can assign to individuals or teams.Runs-on:'Run'':
+Roles work differently for different types of accounts. For more information about accounts, see "Types of GitHub accounts."
+Personal accountsRuns-on:'Run'':
+A repository owned by a personal account has two permission levels: the repository owner and collaborators. For more information, see "Permission levels for a personal account repository."
+Organization accountsRuns-on:'Run'':

++| ---------------------|------------ |------------ |
++| `CI` | [`CI`](/actions/reference/environment-variables#default-environment-variables) | Allows your software to identify that it is running within a CI workflow. Always set to `true`.|
++| `TRAVIS` | [`GITHUB_ACTIONS`](/actions/reference/environment-variables#default-environment-variables) | Use `GITHUB_ACTIONS` to identify whether tests are being run locally or by {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %}.

For example, `refs/heads/<branch_name>` or `refs/tags/<tag_name>`. Alternatvely, `github.head_ref` is the source branch of the pull request in a workflow run; this property is only available when the workflow event trigger is a `pull_request`.  |
++| `TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR` | [`github.workspace`](/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#github-context) | Returns the default working directory for steps, and the default location of your repository when using the [`checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout) action. |

++| `TRAVIS_OS_NAME` | [`runner.os`](/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#runner-context) | The operating system of the runner executing the job. Possible values are `Linux`, `Windows`, or `macOS`. |
++| `TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST` | [`github.event.pull_request.number`](/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhook-events-and-payloads#pull_request) | The pull request number. This property is only available when the workflow event trigger is a `pull_request`. |

+ #### Parallel job processing
+
+ Travis CI can use `stages` to run jobs in parallel. Similarly, {% data variables.product.prodname_actions %} runs `jobs` in parallel. For more information, see "[Creating dependent jobs](/actions/learn-github-actions/managing-complex-workflows#creating-dependent-jobs)."

 About access permissions on GitHubRuns-on:'Run'':
 To perform any actions on GitHub, such as creating a pull request in a repository or changing an organization's billing settings, a person must have sufficient access to the relevant account or resource. This access is controlled by permissions. A permission is the ability to perform a specific action. For example, the ability to delete an issue is a permission. A role is a set of permissions you can assign to individuals or teams.Runs-on:'Run'':
 Roles work differently for different types of accounts. For more information about accounts, see "Types of GitHub accounts."

+Check to see what types of contributions we accept before making changes. Some of them don't even require writing a single line of code âœ¨.
+
+Issues
+Create a new issue
+If you spot a problem with the docs, search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant issue form.
+
+Solve an issue
+Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using labels as filters. See Labels for more information. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.
+
+Make Changes
+Make changes in the UI
+Click Make a contribution at the bottom of any docs page to make small changes such as a typo, sentence fix, or a broken link. This takes you to the .md file where you can make your changes and create a pull request for a review.
+
+
+
+Make changes in a codespace
+For more information about using a codespace for working on GitHub documentation, see "Working in a codespace."
+
+Make changes locally
+Fork the repository.
+Using GitHub Desktop:
+
+Getting started with GitHub Desktop will guide you through setting up Desktop.
+Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to fork the repo!
+Using the command line:
+
+Fork the repo so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.
+Install or update to Node.js, at the version specified in .node-version. For more information, see the development guide.
+
+Create a working branch and start with your changes!
+
+Commit your update
+Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Don't forget to self-review to speed up the review processâš¡.
+
+Pull Request
+When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
+
+Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
+Don't forget to link PR to issue if you are solving one.
+Enable the checkbox to allow maintainer edits so the branch can be updated for a merge. Once you submit your PR, a Docs team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
+We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using suggested changes or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
+As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.
+If you run into any merge issues, checkout this git tutorial to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
+Your PR is merged!
+Congratulations ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ The GitHub team thanks you âœ¨.
+Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible on the GitHub docs.
+Now that you are part of the GitHub docs community, see how else you can contribute to the docs.
+Windows
+This site can be developed on Windows, however a few potential gotchas need to be kept in mind:
+Regular Expressions: Windows uses \rtp/r\nInnerHtml filetype file size limits for line endings, while Unix-based systems use \n. Therefore, when working on Regular Expressions, use \r?\n instead of \n in order to support both environments. The Node.js os.EOL property can be used to get an OS-specific end-of-line marker.
+Paths: Windows systems use \ for the path separator, which would be returned by path.join and others. You could use path.posix, path.posix.join etc and the slash module, if you need forward slashes - like for constructing URLs - or ensure your code works with either.
+Bash: Not every Windows developer has a terminal that fully supports Bash, so it's generally preferred to write scripts in JavaScript instead of Bash.
+Filename too long error: There is a 256 GB file size limit for a filename when Git is compiled with msys. While the suggestions below are not guaranteed to work and could cause other issues, a few workarounds include:
+Update Git configuration: git config --system core.longpaths true
+Consider using a different Git client on Windows

+ #If: your issue was closed without review
Both the [reporting bugs section of the readme](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask#reporting-bugs) and [the bug report issue template you need to fill before opening an issue](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/blob/HEAD/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/01_bug_report.md) warn that if the instructions arenâ€™t followed, your issue may be closed without review.You might have been redirected to this document if it was apparent to a maintainer that was the case. We worked hard on those guides to keep things running smoothly, so we ask you go back and follow them. It is OK to open a new issue for that.
If the maintainer was wrong in closing your issue, please do reply stating why! Closing an issue does not mean the conversation is over. If the guides themselves were unclear, help us improve them! Open *first* an issue or pull request stating what you found confusing *and only then* your other issue.  We understand sometimes users are tired and donâ€™t want to sift through a guide to make what they feel is a simple bug report.  But when each user ignores the guides to save a few minutes, maintainers lose hours and get fatigued. Dealing with the same solved and documented problems leads to maintainer burnout and wasted hours. Those would be better spent improving Homebrew Cask itself and fixing real bugs. We ask you take that into consideration.
  Thank you for understanding and taking the time to make a correct report.   The whole team appreciates it.
