There are a few reasons why you might not be finding a download:

* You can’t access the vendor’s website at all. [Continue here](curl_error_fix_wont_fix.md).
* You can access the vendor’s site but they’re informing you the app is now discontinued. Submit a pull request deleting the cask or [open an issue][01_bug_report] informing us of the situation.
* You can access the vendor’s site but you cannot find the download link. [Open an issue][01_bug_report] and detail all your steps so far.
