There are a few reasons why you might not be finding a download:

* You can’t access the vendor’s website at all. [Continue here](curl_error_fix_wont_fix.md).
* You can access the vendor’s site but they’re informing you the app is now discontinued. Submit a pull request deleting the cask or open an issue [with this template][issue_dead_app] informing us of the situation.
* You can access the vendor’s site but you cannot find the download link. [Open an issue][issue_outdated_cask_but_cannot_find_link] and detail all your steps so far.
