Examples of common errors and their solutions

#### `curl` error:

If the error output includes something like

```
curl: (22) The requested URL returned error: 403 Forbidden
```

the problem was with the downloading itself (see how the error came from `curl`). Homebrew Cask itself is fine and the problem is generally one of:

1. Software vendor or the file in their server is down.
2. Cask is outdated.
3. A problem in your setup or connection.

#### `Permission denied` error:

If the error output includes something like

```
Error: Permission denied - (/usr/local/Caskroom/someapp/0.1/Someapp.app, /Applications/Someapp.app)
```

the problem isn’t with Homebrew Cask itself, but some permissions on your system.

#### `Checksum does not match` error

If the error output includes something like

```
Error: Checksum for Cask 'your-cask' does not match.

Expected: 3dbc6c2205af35db5370c7642b9a2b833668880569b9c64a7f5a670bf9911130
Actual: 526d747d99a93b760f7965e25a57ed61de9b93d566a0ba0c5f1c7e83719b20fd
```

either your download was incomplete/corrupt or the cask is outdated.

#### `source is not there` error

If the error output includes something like

```
It seems the App source '/usr/local/Caskroom/someapp/0.1/Someapp.app' is not there.
```

the directory structure inside the app’s archive changed in some way. It must be fixed in Homebrew Cask.

#### `wrong number of arguments` error

If the error output includes something like

```
Error: wrong number of arguments (1 for 4)
```

it’s likely the software you’re trying to install is incompatible with your macOS version.
