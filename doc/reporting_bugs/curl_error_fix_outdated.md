Since the download started, it likely means the cask is outdated. Lets fix it:

1. Look around the app’s website and find out what the latest version is. It will likely be expressed in the URL used to download it.
2. Take a look at the cask’s version (`brew cask _stanza version {{cask_name}}`) and verify it is indeed outdated.
    * If the app’s version is `latest`, it means the `url` itself is outdated. It will need to be changed to the new one.

If it is outdated, start by trying to [submit a fix](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#updating-a-cask). If you’re having trouble, open an issue [with this template][issue_outdated_cask] explaining your steps so far and why you’re having trouble submitting the update.
