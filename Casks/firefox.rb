  caveats <<-EOS.undent
  The Mac App Store version of 1Password won't work with a Homebrew-cask-linked Mozilla Firefox. To bypass this limitation, you need to either:
    + Move Mozilla Firefox to your /Applications directory (the app itself, not a symlink).
    + Install 1Password from outside the Mac App Store (licenses should transfer automatically, but you should contact AgileBits about it).
