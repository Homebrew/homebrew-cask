  # The filename uses a format like 1.2.3456 for 1.2 (3456) or 1.2.3.4567 for
  # 1.2.3 (4567). Since there are a variable number of parts in the version and
  # the secondary number is appended after the version, this can cause
  # livecheck to incorrectly treat the cask version as newer than the upstream
  # version (e.g., 1.2.3456 is seen as newer than 1.2.3.4567 because 3456 is
  # greater than 3). As a result, we have to artificially split the secondary
  # number and use a two part version format like 1.2,3456 for version
  # comparison to work properly.
