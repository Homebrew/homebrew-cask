    #{token} requires Java 6 like any other IntelliJ-based IDE.
    You can install it with

      brew cask install caskroom/homebrew-versions/java6

    The vendor (JetBrains) doesn't support newer versions of Java (yet)
    due to several critical issues, see details at
    https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/entries/27854363

    To use existing newer Java at your own risk,
    add JVMVersion=1.6+ to ~/Library/Preferences/IntelliJIdea14/idea.properties
