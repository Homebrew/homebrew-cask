      FEniCS is designed to work with the OS X system Python (v. 2.7.5 in OS X 10.9).

      If you are using a standard bash shell and system Python, you can make FEniCS
      available when you start your shell by adding the following to the .profile
      file in your home directory:

        source #{appdir}/FEniCS.app/Contents/Resources/share/fenics/fenics.conf

      If you are using an alternate shell (e.g., zsh, csh) or a modified or brewed Python,
      be sure to launch FEniCS using a clean (bash) shell.
      Creating a new shell using the following command works well:

        /bin/bash --rcfile #{appdir}/FEniCS.app/Contents/Resources/share/fenics/fenics.conf
    EOS
  end
