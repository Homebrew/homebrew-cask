  # We check the wiki homepage for release versions because:
  # * Upstream may upload a new version to the stable download directory
  #   (https://download.documentfoundation.org/libreoffice/stable/) before it's
  #   released.
  # * The contents of the download page can change based on user agent(?),
  #   sometimes in unpredictable ways that break the check, so it's not an
  #   entirely dependable source for us to check.
  # * The libreoffice.org Release Notes page may not be updated in a timely
  #   manner after new releases are announced (whereas the wiki appears to be
  #   updated relatively soon after).
  #
  # NOTE: This needs to check a page that provides the latest versons for both
  # Fresh and Still, as this check is also used by the `libreoffice-still` cask.
