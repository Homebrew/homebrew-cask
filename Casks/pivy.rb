  caveats 'After installing the program itself, the installer will prompt you to insert a YubiKey or other PIV token using a dialog box. Then it will generate a user launchd service to run the agent for you, and add lines to /etc/profile to default to using it in place of the Keychain agent. The pivy- programs will also be added to your PATH, so they should be accessible from any terminal. Youâ€™ll find them in /opt/pivy if you need them for any other reason.'
