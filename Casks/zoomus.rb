    RENAME WARNING

    Due to prevalent user confusion, the zoomus cask (this one) will be renamed to zoom.
    In the meantime, zoomus will install zoom for you as a dependency, but you should update your scripts.

    We’re aware this solution is subpar. If you’d like to help us improve it,
    we accept PRs and need the equivalent of formula_renames.json for casks: https://docs.brew.sh/Rename-A-Formula

    To migrate now, do:
      brew uninstall zoomus
      brew install zoom
  EOS
end
