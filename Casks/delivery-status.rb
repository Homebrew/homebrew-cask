  caveats <<-EOS.undent
    Currently, Dashboard Widgets such as '#{token}' do NOT work correctly
    when installed via brew-cask.  The bug is being tracked here:

      https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/issues/2206

    It is recommended that you do not install this Cask unless you are
    a developer working on the problem.
