  caveats <<~EOS
    #{token} depends on R.
    There are different ways to satisfy that dependency. RStudio recommends installing R from The R Project, which is required to install binary R packages, without needing to compile packages from source.

    https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/217799238

    To install the R Project package run:

      brew cask install r-app

    Alternative ways to satisfy the dependency are:

      brew install r

    This requires compiling R packages from source.
