  # Upstream appears to delete the previous file when switching to a file with
  # a newer date, so we can't use the full URL with the date (the file may
  # eventually disappear and break cask installation) but we also can't use a
  # `sha256` with the redirecting version-only URL because the checksum will
  # change when the redirected date/file changes.
