  caveats <<~EOS
    There's a known issue with Fritzing 0.9.3b, causing it to corrupt its own
    parts-library on first-launch. To avoid this, you must launch Fritzing
    *from the command-line* for the first time:

      $ #{appdir}/Fritzing.app/Contents/MacOS/Fritzing

    Once open, you'll need to explicitly update the parts-library:

      Help â†’ Check for updates...

    Thereafter, at least until the next time you want to update the
    parts-library, you can safely launch it from the Finder.

    See: https://github.com/fritzing/fritzing-app/issues/3308 for more.
