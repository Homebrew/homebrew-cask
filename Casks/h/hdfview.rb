  # The "latest" release on GitHub is set to the `snapshot` release instead of
  # the latest stable version. This checks the version from the filename text
  # on the homepage, so we don't have to use the `GithubReleases` strategy. If
  # we used `GithubReleases`, we would have to create a somewhat involved
  # `strategy` block to avoid releases where part of the version is 99, as
  # upstream doesn't always reliably mark those versions as "pre-release" (e.g.
  # `HDFView-3.3.99` isn't marked as pre-release).
