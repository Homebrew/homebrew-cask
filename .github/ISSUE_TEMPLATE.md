#### General troubleshooting steps

- [ ] I have retried my command with `--force` and the issue is still present.
- [ ] I have checked the instructions for [reporting bugs](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask#reporting-bugs) (or [making requests](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask#requests)) before opening the issue.
  - [ ] None of the templates was appropriate for my issue, or Iâ€™m not sure.
- [ ] I ran `brew update-reset && brew update` and retried my command.
- [ ] I ran `brew doctor`, fixed as many issues as possible and retried my command.
- [ ] I understand that [if I ignore these instructions, my issue may be closed without review](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/blob/master/doc/faq/closing_issues_without_review.md).
