After making all changes to a cask, verify:

- [ ] The submission is for [a stable version](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/blob/master/doc/development/adding_a_cask.md#stable-versions) or [documented exception](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/blob/master/doc/development/adding_a_cask.md#but-there-is-no-stable-version).
- [ ] `brew audit --cask {{cask_file}}` is error-free.
- [ ] `brew style --fix {{cask_file}}` reports no offenses.

- [ ] Checked the cask is submitted to [the correct repo](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/blob/master/doc/development/adding_a_cask.md#finding-a-home-for-your-cask).
- [ ] `brew audit --new-cask {{cask_file}}` worked successfully.
